# Android

This is a repository of Android apps that demonstrate different android features that I find fascinating and their corresponding implementations.
Each feature has a folder of its own that contains a Readme file explaining the different areas to which the feature was implemented and the respective folders for each area of implementation.

Happy Coding!😁
